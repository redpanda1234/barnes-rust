# Theo Mech Computational Project
A rust-implemented Barnes-Hut n-body simulator.

# How to run
Why would you want to do this? It's currently a piece of abject trash.
Oh well. To run, you'll first want to have a working install of rust.
Then, use git to clone the project using
```
git clone https://github.com/redpanda1234/barnes-rust.git
```
To run the project, cd into the `barnes-rust` directory, then do
```
cargo run
```
This should build the project, and execute the binary.
